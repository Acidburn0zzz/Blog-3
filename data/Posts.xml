Just like solving problems, crafting good questions requires you to put in some effort!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ask a focused question that has a specific goal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be precise&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do your homework&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Break it down&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Consider different formulations of the question&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Provide background and motivation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make your title your question&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Format your question well&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Additional resources&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ask a focused question that has a specific goal&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be absolutely clear what constitutes an answer to your question. Here are some examples of vague and specific questions. For each one, ask yourself, &lt;em&gt;&quot;If I saw an answer to this question, could I confidently determine whether it tells the asker what she actually wants to know?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too vague/broad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What can I deduce from X? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is known about the X conjecture?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are all the ways to do X?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tell me about elliptic curves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does X imply Y?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there an example of X such that Y?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the X conjecture true in situation Y?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to do X other than Y (which I can't use because Z)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that being specific does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean plugging in specific numbers or otherwise making your problem look like an exercise in a book. It means asking a to-the-point question that &lt;strong&gt;has an answer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can't turn your question into a specific one, ask yourself what you hope to gain by asking the question. What concrete goal are you moving towards? If you can't think of one, then please don't ask the question. If you just want to know more about some area, read a book or an article or the Wikipedia page or Google for it. Either you'll learn about the subject effortlessly, or at some point you'll get stuck on some very concrete thing. If the former happens, good for you! If the latter happens, then the MathOverflow community is here to help you get unstuck. If you have a concrete goal, but your question is extremely broad, break it down into more focused questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Be precise&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being precise means communicating the parameters of your question so that others know where to start answering it and know when they've given you a complete answer. Of course, the includes stating the hypotheses and goal of your problem. If you suspect that you're asking an elementary question outside of your field, you may also want to explain your background a bit. This makes it easier for the person answering your question to know what she can take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is especially important for &quot;soft&quot; questions and &quot;big list&quot; questions to be precise. Otherwise they'll be boring and useless. &lt;em&gt;&quot;What are the best number theory books&quot;&lt;/em&gt; is a bad question. Best for what? Assuming what background? A better version of the question might be &lt;em&gt;&quot;What are the best textbooks for an undergraduate number theory course?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;After an undergraduate number theory course, what should I learn if I want to study elliptic curve cryptography?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; These questions aren't great, but they make it clear what the starting point is and what the goal is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure it's clear exactly what your question is. It's extremely frustrating to read a long question which explains what the general problem is but doesn't contain an actual question. I usually resort to searching the body of the post for question marks, but it often doesn't help. After defining all your terms and motivating your question, consider visually distinguishing the final version of the question (see the formatting section).&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are few things worse than a question which is too vague, too broad, or imprecise. Not only is it lazy to ask a vague or imprecise question, it's also rude. You're essentially asking somebody to do the work of figuring out what you want to ask, and then answer it, or to answer several possible interpretations of your question. Suppose somebody asks, &lt;em&gt;&quot;What do you guys think about Foobar's new paper?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Even if this is exactly in my field, and I understand Foobar's paper better than Foobar himself, I have no idea where to start answering a question like that. Compare to, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Does Foobar's regularization construction solve the Baz-Flipt Conjecture?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; As an expert, this is something I can actually answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you're browsing MO, please don't vote up unfocused or imprecise questions. Such questions are as bad as (or worse than) homework questions; they waste everybody's time. If somebody asks, &lt;em&gt;&quot;What's the deal with algebraic geometry?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; you might say to yourself, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Wow, I'd really love to see a great answer to that one. I'm going to vote it up.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But don't!&lt;/strong&gt; You're encouraging the wrong behavior. The great answer you're hoping for doesn't exist because there isn't a precise question. At best, somebody will answer, &lt;em&gt;&quot;go read a survey article or a standard reference or the nLab page or the Wikipedia page.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Worse, somebody who is too kind and too generous with her time may spend a great deal of time and energy crafting an answer that might not satisfy the asker and that will be just a shadow of a proper survey paper. Such questions can't be reasonably answered in a few hours, even by an expert who knows the &quot;answer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Do your homework&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before asking your question, try to solve it. Search &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nLab&lt;/a&gt;, check any references you can think of, and try to figure the problem out yourself (maybe even sleep on it). Doing so will help you break the problem down and understand it better. Even if you don't solve the problem, putting some work into it will often help you understand exactly what it is you're having trouble with, so you'll be able to ask a better question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Break it down&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may have a specific problem you're trying to solve, and you may have done your research, but the problem might be a monster. Even if it's not a monster, you'll probably benefit from trying to break the problem into smaller pieces and posting one or two of the pieces on MO. To modify a quotation of P&amp;oacute;lya, &quot;If there is a problem you can't solve, then there is an easier problem you can't solve: find it.&quot; You may worry that the the pieces are not interesting enough or are too specific to post on MathOverflow, but you shouldn't. It's much better to post a question that is too focused than to post a question that is too vague or too broad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's okay to ask several questions related to a project you're working on, but try to limit yourself to one or two per day. Rather than posting all the parts of your problem at the same time, work through them one at a time. After all, the solution to one part may completely change your plan for solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Consider different formulations of the question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your question is boring, but you can often make it much more interesting by recontextualizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be enough to just ask if your question is false. For example, you might be reading a book when you come across &lt;em&gt;&quot;Theorem 2.1. Every regular doodad is a widgit.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; You read the proof, but you don't understand where it uses the hypothesis that the doodad is regular. Your question is &lt;em&gt;&quot;Where does the author of this book use the regularity hypothesis in Theorem 2.1?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; That is a boring question! But answering it is equivalent to answering an interesting question, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Is every doodad a widgit?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; That is, does the result remain true if you remove (or weaken) the hypothesis? Ask the more interesting question, and add &lt;em&gt;&quot;I ask because I'm reading the proof of Theorem 2.1 of this book, which shows that regular doodads are widgits, but it looks like it doesn't use the regularity hypothesis.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing you could try is to broaden the appeal of your question by generalizing it. Generalizing is actually a way of breaking the question down, since it amounts to removing hypotheses. For example, you might be trying to prove that some particular object X is a widgit. Asking &lt;em&gt;&quot;Is X a widgit?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; might not be a very interesting question. So you do your homework by looking for references and by trying to prove it in various ways. Eventually, you realize that the basic property of X that should force it to be a widgit is that it is a doodad, so you ask yourself, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Is every doodad a widgit?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Of course not; it's easy to come up with doodads that aren't widgits. There must be some other property of X that will allow you to prove it's a widgit. Maybe it's because X is a &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; doodad. After thinking about it for a while, you think that it's plausible that every regular doodad is a widgit. If you can't come up with a proof or a counterexample, then you could ask, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Is every regular doodad a widgit?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; If you do, you may want to explain in a background/motivation section that you're really trying to show that X is a widgit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Provide background and motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MathOverflow isn't just a place to ask and answer questions. It's also a place to read questions and answers, which is a great way to see what people in other fields think about, and to see how they actually think about it (not just what the polished papers look like). So when you ask for the help of those who know more than you, please also extend a hand to those who know less than you by explaining why you are asking the question. You'll get more votes, generate more interest, and are more likely to get your question answered. Explaining the motivation for a question may also help you gain a fresh outlook on the topic you're asking about. MO is meant to develop your ability to do mathematics, but also to develop your ability to communicate it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Make your title your question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use your title to convey as much information about your question as possible. Since the tags already convey the general subject area of your question, the title should communicate the question itself as faithfully as possible. If necessary, leave out hypotheses in the title, and in the body of the question, explain why the question requires those hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't be afraid to make your question title long. Titles are allowed to be anywhere from 15 to 250 characters long. 140 characters (the length of a tweet) takes up about two full lines on the home page, so try to keep it less than that. But 140 characters is a lot longer than you might think. Too many people restrict themselves to 20 character titles. They're trying not to waste your time by making you read a long title, but they end up wasting more of your time because you have to actually open the question to see if it's interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Format your question well&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The readability of your question can often be greatly improved if you learn to use &lt;a href=&quot;/editing-help&quot;&gt;formatting commands&lt;/a&gt;, especially if your question ends up being quite long. Here is an example that contains a few good uses of the formatting commands:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Background/Motivation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A *doodad* is a thingumabob together with a sheaf of doohickies (which is usually called the *doo structure* on the doodad). A doodad is said to be *regular* if the sheaf of doohickies is regular. Intuitively, regularity makes a doodad &quot;rigid&quot; since information about the doo structure at a point can be translated into information about the doo structure at nearby points.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A *widgit* is a whatsit which is flat (in the sense that its Plotsky curvature is zero). Showing that a space has a widgit on it is extremely useful because the flatness allows you to apply Foobar's gadget construction to prove many useful results about the space.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;----&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Based on the above intuition, it is natural to ask if every doodad is a widgit. However, the answer is clearly no, since a widgit is always regular, but [some example] is a non-regular doodad, so it is clear that we must impose a regularity hypothesis.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Is every regular doodad a widgit?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;Background/Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;doodad&lt;/em&gt; is a thingumabob together with a sheaf of doohickies (which is usually called &gt;the &lt;em&gt;doo structure&lt;/em&gt; on the doodad). A doodad is said to be &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; if the sheaf of &gt;doohickies is regular. Intuitively, regularity makes a doodad &quot;rigid&quot; since information &gt;about the doo structure at a point can be translated into information about the doo &gt;structure at nearby points.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;widgit&lt;/em&gt; is a whatsit which is flat (in the sense that its Plotsky curvature is zero). &gt;Showing that a space has a widgit on it is extremely useful because the flatness allows &gt;you to apply Foobar's gadget construction to prove many useful results about the space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Based on the above intuition, it is natural to ask if every doodad is a widgit.

The words being defined are italicized. After the nuances about why the question introduces some hypotheses, the precise final question is visually distinguished in a blockquote, making it easy to know exactly what constitutes an answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;A final note&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not every piece of advice on this page may apply to your problem, and it may even occasionally happen that you can make your question better by violating some rule laid out on this page. As with any writing you do, it is important to know what the basic rules are. If you violate one of them, it should be a conscious choice and you should be doing it for a very good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Additional resources&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eric Raymond's &lt;a href=&quot;http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;How To Ask Questions The Smart Way&lt;/a&gt; is directed at people looking to post problems to computer software/hardware forums, but much of the advice applies to asking questions on MathOverflow as well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;User contributed content licensed under the &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;with &#xA;attribution required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7507" LastActivityDate="2013-06-25T18:41:52.143" CommentCount="1" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-06-25T18:41:52.143" />

I suggest that you wait for a month (or two), check the migration stats (available to 10k+ users), and make individual meta posts for each migration path you want.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chatroom Etiquette and owners&lt;/strong&gt;: It's not yet clear if &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/9369/mathoverflow&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; is going to be used much.

If you do indeed decide to use it, I suggest you draft out a chatroom etiquette post &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/3890/main-chatroom-etiquette-rules&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of folks have expressed concerns over chat being flooded by homework; you may want to explicitly make it off topic for chat (and thus homework askers can be easily kicked, and chatbanned if persistent).

If you feel that there are enough people in the community who will be able to maintain a steady stream of posts, start a meta post about this, asking if the community thinks that it's a good idea and fielding for volunteers.

The right thing to do is to &quot;skip&quot;. But the system is gamefied in such a way as to incentivise taking action anyway.

This means that sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://academia.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Academia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Computational Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cs.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophy.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; are currently not an option for user-driven migrations. This is done to minimize the chances of newer sites and/or sites that have yet to cement their long-term success from being potentially overwhelmed with effectively rejected question from other sites in the network. We ideally want every beta to form its own voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a pinch, diamond moderators have the ability to migrate a question to any site in the network (so long as it's not in the private beta stage), but this is ideally only done for exceptionally good questions and not just anything that could conceivably be asked somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; is an obvious choice and it's already enabled, but beyond that I would like to suggest letting MathOverflow run as is for at least a few weeks to see what sort of questions you keep getting and what sites they get migrated to. We collect statistics on how many questions are migrated, where they end up, and whether or not those migrations are rejected by the destination site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Aside: migrations are considered to be rejected by the destination site when migrated questions are closed as anything other than &quot;duplicate&quot; or deleted. This is another flood prevention mechanism.)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks/months, we all will have a better handle of what migration paths make the most sense and are most successful.

There was an intelligent comment from Neil Strickland, and also a comment that it's an imprecise question and should therefore be closed.

Maybe the other point is more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Postscript:&lt;/b&gt; Angelo draws parallels to the proposition that every question about zero sets of polynomials is on topic.

I've just notified them by email.  However, the fact that mathoverflow's notification system has no way to handle such a matter is a flaw.  Some users' email addresses cannot readily be found.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PPPS:&lt;/b&gt; I wonder if anyone anywhere knows the answer to the question I posted, which was held not to be a research-level question.  Just this morning I derived a simple result: The function $\theta\mapsto\tan(\theta/2)$ is the identity element in a structure that one naturally considers when thinking about this question.  Maybe high-school-level in the sense that if one phrased it as a precise question, a bright high-school student would prove it.  But I wouldn't be surprised it hasn't been noticed before.  And it would take an even brighter high-school student to think of asking that question.  Which raises a question that I'll ask on &quot;main&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PPPPS:&lt;/b&gt; One should ask a &quot;focused question&quot; with a &quot;specific goal&quot;.

One off simple questions are fine, such as &quot;&lt;em&gt;Do you folks mind sanity checking something for me? I can't believe I'm getting this result&lt;/em&gt;&quot; - or similar. If a question is sufficiently involved that a protracted response is warranted, chat is the wrong place to be asking, regardless of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of chat as something of a pub, where you arrive to a group of your peers engaged in a lively conversation. It's one thing to interrupt them quickly to ask for directions, it's another to expect that everyone would be suddenly interested in abandoning their otherwise enjoyable chatter to divert their full attention to something much less entertaining. It's a simple matter of manners - when you join a group, it's your obligation to fit in agreeably to the extent that others are willing to receive you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As pointed out by some of our very helpful network moderators, each room has a topic. You're more than welcome to explicitly disallow homework related questions within that topic. Additionally:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderators and room owners can pin messages that remain visible to the right, these lead to chat transcripts that are considered important.

It's fine to politely point out that you simply don't entertain such questions, and would appreciate the user refraining from pursuing them further. You can, at your option and discretion, point the user in a more appropriate direction if one exists. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since deployment, we've found chat to be an &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; feature for fostering strong, lasting relationships within our communities.

The scenario that you describe is applicable to many communities, and they handle it quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I recommend you do is set up a few rooms to help organize chat initially.

These are not for general idle chit chat, these are rooms where people really passionate about [topic] get together to learn from each other (gallery rooms can sometimes be useful here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We (Stack Exchange) are here to help, we're at your disposal.

In your own enlightened self-interest, realize that participating in blogs, MathOverflow, the arXiv, and mathematical publishing are all forms of advertising for your &quot;brand&quot;, even if that’s not your principal purpose (and hopefully it’s not). Since job applications require you to write your real name, you might as well use it everywhere else, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using real names reminds everybody that they are corresponding with real people, and it demonstrates a certain level of personal investment in your MathOverflow identity.

Of course, individual questions don't have to be worthy of an article, and they don't have to be about new mathematics. A typical example is, &quot;Can this hypothesis in that theorem be relaxed in this way?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site works best for &lt;strong&gt;well-defined questions&lt;/strong&gt;: math questions that actually have a specific answer. You'll notice that there is the occasional question making a list of something, asking about the workings of the mathematical community, or something else which isn't really a math question. Such questions can be helpful to the community, but it is extremely tricky to ask them in a way that produces a useful response. So if you're new to the site, we suggest you stick to asking precise math questions until you learn about the quirks of the community and the strengths of the medium. If you have a very broad question (like &quot;Please explain topic X&quot;), try searching &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;nLab&lt;/a&gt;, or looking for survey articles on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/find/math&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please look around to see if your question has already been asked (and maybe even answered!). If you do post a question that was asked here before, don't worry; somebody will give you a link and close your question as duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to get great answers to your question is to write a great question. To help you do that, we've written down some guidelines on &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.mathoverflow.net/a/126/&quot;&gt;How to ask a good MathOverflow question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7507" LastActivityDate="2013-06-26T23:00:33.387" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-06-26T23:00:33.387" />

If a question is closed, it's probably because it fell into one of these categories. If your question is closed, please don't take this to mean that you are not welcome on the site, or think that this will be held against you in the future. A lot of active users have had questions closed at one point or another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;MathOverflow is not for homework help.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to make sure your question is of interest to at least one other &lt;strong&gt;mathematician&lt;/strong&gt;. Though there are no hard and fast rules about who may post here, the intended audience is professional mathematicians, mathematics graduate students, and advanced undergraduates. If your question is closed as &quot;off topic,&quot; it might be because it was too elementary. This doesn't mean that your question is &quot;bad,&quot; just that MathOverflow isn't the right place for it. But there are lots of other math Q&amp;amp;A sites where your question might fit right in, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;math.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/dr/math/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ask Dr. Math&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Art of Problem Solving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physicsforums.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Physics Forums&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://nrich.maths.org/discus/messages/board-topics.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NRICH&lt;/a&gt;. If your question was closed as &quot;too localized,&quot; it was probably an explicit homework problem (or looked like one). MathOverflow is not the right place for such questions; they send the message that you want somebody else to do your work for you, and you're not even willing to ask it in a general form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;MathOverflow is not a discussion forum.&lt;/strong&gt; As a side-effect of being very good for to-the-point questions and answers, the Stack Exchange software is bad for discussions and &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to minimize them. There's a place for discussion about mathematics, but it isn't MathOverflow. Blogs and threaded discussion forums are a more appropriate place for discussions. For more information on this, see the relevant tea.mathoverflow.net threads (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tea.mathoverflow.net/discussion/106/on-discussions-in-somo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;MathOverflow is not an encyclopedia.&lt;/strong&gt; MO is a site for questions that &lt;strong&gt;have answers&lt;/strong&gt;. MathOverflow visitors should know how to learn new things and do mathematics on their own, but we all get stuck sometimes, and this is where MO saves the day. When you're stuck, you can come to MathOverflow and say &quot;I'm trying to do X. How can I do that? Does this work? Does anybody have a reference?&quot; The idea being that for an expert, it should take very little effort to understand your confusion and set you on the right path. Or maybe a non-expert has come across the same sticking point and can explain how she resolved it. MathOverflow is not the appropriate place to ask somebody to write an expository article for you. If you want somebody to write an article about some subject, you should make a stub on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/FAQ#where_do_i_ask_a_question_13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;query block on nLab&lt;/a&gt;, or make a &lt;a href=&quot;http://planetmath.org/?op=reqlist&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;request on PlanetMath&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;MathOverflow is not for questions about MathOverflow.&lt;/strong&gt; Mathematicians don't come here to learn about the intricacies of this site; they come here to get answers to their questions.

The second (&quot;relative-sheaf&quot;) could very well be replaced with &quot;sheaves&quot;, and the third (&quot;induced-subgraph&quot;) is so niche that it could be replaced by the existing tag &quot;subgraph&quot;.

Save that for the 30,000+ character Markdown tag wiki. The excerpt should define the shared quality of questions containing this tag — boiled down to a few short sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized.&lt;/strong&gt; The “email” tag, for example, does not need to explain what email is. I think we can safely assume most internet users know what email is; there’s no value in a boilerplate explanation of email to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentrate on what a tag means to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; community.&lt;/strong&gt; For “email” on Server Fault, mention the server aspects of email including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and server software. For “email” on Super User, mention desktop email clients and explicitly exclude webmail, as that would be more appropriate for webapps.stackexchange.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, what kinds of questions should have this tag? Tags only exist as ways of organizing questions, so if we don’t provide proper guidance on which questions need this tag, they won’t get tagged at all, rendering the tag excerpt moot. Think of it as a sales pitch: in a room full of tags screaming “pick me!”, what would convince a question asker to select your tag?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some tags are common knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; Most tags require a bit of explanation in the excerpt, even if it’s only 3 or 4 words. But if the tag is common knowledge — that is, if you walked up to any random person on the street and said the tag word to them, and they would know what you were talking about — then don’t bother explaining the tag at all. Stick to usage of the tag within your community in the excerpt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/redesigned-tags-page/&quot;&gt;Redesigned Tags Page&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;SE Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7507" LastEditorUserId="7507" LastEditDate="2013-06-27T02:52:09.400" LastActivityDate="2013-06-27T02:52:09.400" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-06-27T02:44:34.477" />

This feature might be something that one could add. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sort of answer my own suggestion. A counter-argument, as @all was removed and only one @ per comment is valid, might be that neither does one wish to have a somewhat bulk-ish notifier for all voters (of a given type) nor does one want to encourage five comments being posted to notify each individually. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, it is not that feasible idea in the end.

Thanks to Manishearth and Kaveh for information.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the question grew out of a somewhat complicated situation and thus might not be presented in an optimal way, I think it touches a very valid point. I do not fully share the specific suggestion of automatic notification when a meta-thread is created, it feels a bit complicated, might not always be necessary and is also somewhat limiting (see below). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main issue it raises in my mind is whether &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; can be notified via an @ is sufficient/optimal? (I do not yet fully oversee this notification-system so I might say something that is not true, I welcome corrections.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand one can notifiy users that commented and OP is automatically notified. But, I think it could be useful to be able to notify &lt;em&gt;everybody that interacted with a post in a substantive way&lt;/em&gt;, that is also users that edited, closed (does one now say, had put it on hold?) or reopened it. Or, to put this differently: &lt;em&gt;users that show up in the revision-history of the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can easily imagine situations where it could be useful to be able to ping somebody that made an edit to a post to get some clarification about a choice they made when doing so, for example. Also to be able to draw the attention from closers or reopeners to some debate could be useful, or also just to ask them specifically in cases of doubts what was the moticatiing reason could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cannot really follow Manishearth explication that it does not matter so much who debates and also that people will notice the comment on main or the question on meta. By the same token on could question the usefulness of the entire notification system, since also a follow-up comment can just be noticed or answered by somebody else (and we lived quite well without notifications until very recently on MO). Yet, if one thinks that the possibility to notify is convenient (as I do), then I do not see why one should not also be able to notify a user that edited or closed (in addition to thos that commented).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, I would like to present my slight modification of Michael Hardy's feature request: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Add the possibility to notify those users (via @) that show up in the revision history of a post (that is, users that edited or contributed to a completed closing or reopening).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this would allow to address the problem Michael Hardy raised, and could also be useful in other ways, such as being able to ask for clarifications related to an edit. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-06-28T01:10:03.253" LastActivityDate="2013-06-28T01:10:03.253" CommentCount="10" />

Even stranger, the person who wrote that answer and the person placing the bounty are the same. This happened on another question as well.

Perhaps she's playing around to learn the system better. But it raised two questions for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, what happens when a bounty of the sort above expires? I assume her answer will win, because it's already the optimal answer. So she'll get back the reputation she wagered and also whatever happens to you when you win a bounty (badges I guess). So in the end the bounty won't produce any new math and won't lead to a transfer of reputation from one user to another. It will however lead to more publicity for the question and answer, and that leads to lots of upvotes. Hence my second question: is this the sort of thing we want happening on MathOverflow? The same thing happens on a lesser scale when someone edits an old question, but the front-page turnover rate is fast so those only stay for an hour or two. Also, there's a disincentive because if you bump your old question/answer too many times it'll become CW. But a question with a bounty stays advertised for a whole week.

Turn out was not overwhelming but not as minimal as the score could suggest. Thanks to everyone who participated. At the time of writing we have +4 vs -4. So, opinions are mixed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My personal conclusion: since there is no &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt; consensus against this edit (if I were to include my opinion in the count there would be a minimal majority against it though), I intend to &lt;em&gt;approve&lt;/em&gt; (somewhat against my very personal opinion) such edits in the future (I did not reject much during the last week either), and by extension most suggested edits (except of course if there is some actual problem with the edit). The reasoning being that sometimes such edits being approved and sometimes such edits being rejected should be an annoyance for those suggesting them in good faith. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If somebody would still like to express their opinion, feel free to continue voting. I will continue to watch the score as I am generally curious about existing opinions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to revisit this matter with an example. (I am not sure if I rather should edit my existing answer or ask a new question but anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me there is no real consensus reached at all. There is one highly voted answer, however, it is very unspecific so that everybody can read it their way. (I did not get any reply for my request for clarification on what the poster, Andres Caicedo, meant; let alone finding out what the voters mean.) The bandwidth of in my opinion reasonable interpretations ranges from editing should be done if &lt;em&gt;an only if&lt;/em&gt; something displays in an actually wrong way to every improvement however small is an improvement and should be done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, from my observation and his comment-reply to Yemon Choi I think that Andres Caicedo's and my views are actually not that incompatible, somewhat in the middle of the bandwith in that actual correction should be done and the rest if there is significant room for  improvement (increasing readablity and clarity in a noticeable way), the answer does however leave much room for interpretation. Thus this follow-up. So, now, for the specific example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed the edit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/21003/polynomial-bijection-from-mathbb-q-times-mathbb-q-to-mathbb-q&quot;&gt;Polynomial bijections from Q x Q to Q&lt;/a&gt; now improved to  &quot;Polynomial bijections from $\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$  to $\mathbb{Q}$&quot; (this is the full improvement!) I rejected it as 'too minor' one of the default reasons, however, it was approved by two others so it took effect. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As said, the edit consisted in changing &lt;em&gt;only in the title&lt;/em&gt;, for the rest it was not necessary as already done long ago, &quot;Q x Q to Q&quot; to &quot;$\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$  to $\mathbb{Q}$&quot;. In my opinion, an edit can hardly be more minor than this (also the question was old, also in the sense of not having been active very recently). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in a recent discussion on the board now know as tea, the sentiment was expressed by some, not including me I was rather on the opposite side of the debate, that &quot;texifying&quot; is not universally appreciated, in particular not in irrelevant cases (where there is no risk of misunderstanding or decrease of readability), also mentioning loading time as concern. (I do not fully agree with this, but specifically for titles I agree, as the commulated longer loading for lists of question can be annoying.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to cut a long story short: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should edits like changing &quot;Q x Q to Q&quot; to &quot;$\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q}$  to $\mathbb{Q}$&quot; &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; when it is &lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt; the rationals are meant be made even if it bumps the question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps let us say vote &lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; for: no, they should not be made, and &lt;strong&gt;down&lt;/strong&gt; for yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I hope it is alright to use answers in this form and induce voting in this way; I CW it though not sure this is relevant on meta.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-07-06T21:52:35.547" LastActivityDate="2013-07-06T21:52:35.547" CommentCount="33" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-06-29T22:26:22.213" />

While any current information about this would be welcome, the switch to SE 2.0 is still quite recent, so perhaps the data should be reviewed in a few weeks to get a better sense of the effect of the switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The questions to be counted would be those that were migrated to math.SE (though of course this has only been an option since the switch), and those that were simply closed due to inappropriateness.

One thing that may help would be to do a site-wide search for comments such as &quot;&lt;em&gt;Crossposted to math.SE [link]&lt;/em&gt;&quot; because this would correlate well to questions that were ultimately closed for being inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suspect the answer will be that this rate has increased. I seem to remember that part of the agreement behind the switch was that MathOverflow would be invisible to the rest of the SE 2.0 network (though not the other way around), precisely to avoid this effect. Was this condition of the agreement discarded? Do people feel that it would be good to implement (regardless of its previous status)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am using the term &quot;switch&quot;, instead of &quot;migration&quot;, to avoid confusion with the migration of questions between different sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1916" LastEditorUserId="1916" LastEditDate="2013-06-30T10:50:41.423" LastActivityDate="2013-07-01T14:27:26.670" Title="Has the switch to SE 2.0 increased the rate of low-level / inappropriate questions?"

In particular, KConrad's OpenID string for mathoverflow.net is different from the one for stackexchange.com, and since it appears all other sites in the network used by KConrad are [something].stackexchange.com for KConrad only MO has the property of upon login not giving his OpenID string for stackexchange.com (but rather mathoverflow.net). [Added: This is wrong, since the OpenID strings for different stackexchange.com are also different, and the subsequent speculations are thus also not correct.] (A more elaborated and abstract version of this is to be found in said blog-post.) After this explanation the blog-post says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That’s a major bummer for site networks like us with multiple domains. We use the OpenID string as your user &quot;fingerprint&quot;, so if your &quot;fingerprint&quot; changes, we can’t tell who you are any more. It’s a frustrating problem, but we think we’ve finally come up with a fix: &lt;strong&gt;we demand email from Google GMail OpenIDs!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, SE has typically two identifying pieces of information for a user (using Google OpenID). &lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt; OpenID string, generated for some of their domainnames (likely the first ever used) and the associated email address (to get this they need to ask permission, which is the step discussed here). This email is then stored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume KConrad's &quot;fingerprint&quot; (see the quote above) is his OpenID string&#xA;&lt;em&gt;for stackexchange.com&lt;/em&gt;. This OpenID string is likely the same over all the others sites except MO he uses, as all seem to be [something].stackexchange.com (yet not stackoverflow.com for example), so the &lt;em&gt;domainname is the same&lt;/em&gt; and Google gives out the same string. Likely, permission was granted SE &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;, and now long ago, to retrive the email address when he started using the network. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus, when he logs in to one of the stackexchange.com sites the system recognizes the OpenID string Google gives (the one for SE.com) as his  &quot;fingerprint&quot; and thus has no need for the email address.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If however, he logs in to MO, then Google gives his OpenID string for MO.net, which is different. Thus, this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; his &quot;fingerprint&quot; and the system does not recognize him. And, thus, needs to ask for the second piece of indentifying information the email-address. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason that this was a non-issue on the old MO is that there was only one domainname at all, and thus the OpenID string was always suffcient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason that this does not happen to everybody using Google OpenID for MO now, is that for some (in particular those not having had an account on the network before) their &quot;fingerprint&quot; is the OpenID for MO.net. Likely, they have the dual problem, being asked on each stackexchange.com site (as reported by Scott Morrison). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possibly a solution:&lt;/strong&gt; (This is only a rephrasing of my understanding of what Manishearth said already.) It seems to be possible to add more than one OpenID string to an account, i.e., to have more than one &quot;fingerprint&quot; recognized by the system. So, via adding the OpenID string for MO.net as additional fingerprint to the account, KConrad might be able to avoid having to grant permission each time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-07-04T10:22:05.730" LastActivityDate="2013-07-04T10:22:05.730" CommentCount="3" />

Namely, every mathematician hopes that the questions on which they are currently working---whether for their dissertation or a later project----is an open question. These open questions come in all types, some interesting, some difficult. Let us welcome them here and give them our attention and consideration. I suspect that with the talented people we have here on MO, many of these questions will find an answer. This is a sense in which I think that nearly everyone already agrees on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But second, in a wider sense, I think that it would actually be good for the site for us to encourage people to ask open questions of all sorts, including very prominent ones. Surely there is a continuum of open questions ranging from very easy ones up to the more normal MO questions and on up to the famous open questions. There already are some very interesting open questions on MO, such as the question on polynomial bijections from $\mathbb{Q}\times\mathbb{Q}\to\mathbb{Q}$ and many others, which I think of as highlights of the site, even though they are open. Let's build a collection of the best questions in mathematics! As answers, we can post information about resources, history, partial solutions, related problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would expect that many of the more famous open questions could become some of the highest-voted questions on the site, a situation that would address the worry some have had about other softer questions currently occupying that role. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that the top-voted questions on MathOverflow were all the most popular open questions in mathematics!

This will show you exactly what the person typed in order to get the result you see. If the post has not been edited, then it's a little trickier to view the edit history. First you have to find the number of the post. If the post is a question, then it has a url like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;number&lt;/b&gt;/blah-foo-bar. If the post is an answer, you can click the &quot;link&quot; link at the bottom of the answer to get a url like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/123/blah-foo-bar/&quot;&gt;Linearity of the inner product using the parallelogram law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;number&lt;/b&gt;#&lt;b&gt;number&lt;/b&gt; (the two &lt;b&gt;numbers&lt;/b&gt; will be the same). Once you know the number of the post, you can get to the edit history by going to the URL &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/revisions/&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/revisions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;number&lt;/b&gt;/list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmark/Favorite a question&lt;/strong&gt;. Suppose you really like a question or you really want to be able to find it easily later. You can add it to your favorite questions list by clicking the little star next to the question. Click the star again to &quot;unfavorite&quot; it. To see a list of your favorite questions, go to the &quot;favorites&quot; tab on your user page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use problematic characters in URLs&lt;/strong&gt;. Sometimes your links will behave strangely in posts because they contain a disallowed character. For example, the text&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo&lt;/a&gt;–Mumford_regularity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt; ends up linking to&lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt; To fix this, you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;percent encode&lt;/a&gt; the troublesome character. In this case, you’d type&lt;br&gt; &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo%E2%80%93Mumford_regularity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castelnuovo%E2%80%93Mumford_regularity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt; to get a good link.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All characters outside ISO Latin 1 are disallowed, and need to be encoded using their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UTF-8&lt;/a&gt; byte sequence (e.g., the en-dash character above, U+2013, is represented as E2 80 93 in UTF-8, hence it is percent-encoded as %E2%80%93). Furthermore, some ASCII characters require percent encoding, because they conflict with Markdown syntax, or because they are URL reserved characters. This list may be non-exhaustive:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(space)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%2A&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%24&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%5B&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%5D&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%28&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%29&lt;/code&gt;&#xA;  &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other reserved characters may appear in a URL, but they have a special function: e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_variety&amp;amp;action=history&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebraic_variety&amp;amp;action=history&lt;/a&gt;. They need to be percent-encoded when this special function is not intended: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many browsers automatically percent-encode non-ASCII characters and reserved characters (but not Markdown special characters) as necessary in URLs copied from the address bar, sparing you the trouble of manual encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow up on your recent comments&lt;/strong&gt;. It's easy to follow up when somebody replies to one of your posts (see tip #1), but you might find yourself saying, &quot;I left a comment that I really meant to check up on later, but I can't remember where I left it.&quot; In that case, try clicking the &quot;recent&quot; tab on your user page. It will show you a list of all the comments you left in reverse chronological order, along with links to the posts on which you left them. It also shows you when you asked, answered, edited, or accepted an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSS feeds&lt;/strong&gt;. MathOverflow has feeds for recent questions, questions within a given tag, activity on a single question, activity of a given user, and probably some others I don't know about. To find the link for the feed, just scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the  (e.g. to get the feed for a given user's activity, scroll to the bottom of that users profile page; to get the feed for recent questions, scroll down to the bottom of the home page).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the colors mean?&lt;/strong&gt; The color of the &quot;number of answers&quot; box and the background color of an answer tells you the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Votes box, Answer background, Question background&#xA;  unanswered, answered, accepted, accepted, deleted, has interesting tag, has ignored tag&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape Markdown special characters&lt;/strong&gt;. Characters like * and _ have special meaning in Markdown (the markup language used by the WMD editor). You can escape them with a backslash. For example, write &lt;code&gt;\*test\*&lt;/code&gt; to get &quot;*test*&quot; rather than &quot;&lt;em&gt;test&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. You can also escape these characters in comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use boolean operators on tags.&lt;/strong&gt; You probably already noticed that you can see all questions with a given tag by clicking on the tag, and maybe even that you can combine tags to see questions that use both (by clicking on the &quot;related tags&quot;), but you can also search for questions that use one tag OR another or search for questions that use one tag, but NOT another. For example, the URL&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/homological-algebra%20or%20representation-theory%20-algebraic-geometry&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/tagged/homological-algebra&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/tagged/homological-algebra&lt;/a&gt; or representation-theory -algebraic-geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;will show you a list of questions that are tagged ([homological-algebra] OR ([representation-theory] but NOT [algebraic-geometry])).&#xA;NOT (denoted by by prefixing a &quot;-&quot;) binds tighter than AND (denoted by a space) binds tighter than OR (denoted by the word &quot;or&quot;). See &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/tags-and-tags-or-tags/&quot;&gt;this blog.SO post&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildcards in tags.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use ~ as a wildcard when searching tags. For example, to find all questions that have a tag ending in &quot;geometry&quot;, go to&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/~geometry&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/tagged/~geometry&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/tagged/~geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrict to certain tags in searches.&lt;/strong&gt; When you use the search box, anything between brackets is interpreted as a tag, so the search &quot;[ac.commutative-algebra] decomposition&quot; searches &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the [ac.commutative-algebra] tag for questions containing the word &quot;decomposition&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See original math input.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes you want to see the original input corresponding to some MathJax output. You can see it by right clicking on the MathJax output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search MathOverflow like a ninja.&lt;/strong&gt; Let's face it: MathOverflow's search functionality is sometimes not so hot, but you can take advantage of the fact that MathOverflow is heavily indexed by Google. If you want to search comments or search for a phrase, you can use a google search like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/#q=site:http%3A%2F%2Fmathoverflow.net+%22wicked+smooth%22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;site:&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net&lt;/a&gt; &quot;wicked smooth&quot;&lt;/a&gt; or site:&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net&lt;/a&gt; &quot;can't argue with that&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This trick can also be used to search user pages. For example, if you want to find MathOverflow users whose profile contains the phrase &quot;finite groups&quot;, try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amathoverflow.net%2Fusers%2F+%22finite+groups%22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;site:mathoverflow.net/users/ &quot;finite groups&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

There is simply a big difference between making a post that is on some paper, and a post happening to link to a paper. (This remains true if this is restricted to links in questions.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also applies to the arXiv trackback in a certain way. But first there are many many papers on the arXiv while there are not yet that many posts on this site, so it is in a relative sense not so much problem, besides these trachbacks on the arXiv being quite a side-aspect while on this site they are the main thing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if we send them many low-quality entries (at least for the purpose at hand) this is seems like a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Final explication what I mean with &quot;problematic&quot;: sometimes certain (not all) discussions of preprints here on MO are critizised as potentially offensive or embarassing for the author, &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a track-back is created, as it is automatic, so that everybody looking at the arXiv might stumble over this potentially offensive discussion. This is a slightly strange state of affairs in my opinion. But then these trackbacks are not so visible, but for that other site this is a bit different. In addition, it could also make sense to inform people that what they say here on MO on a paper, will in some immediate way be linked to the paper. It is not clear to me if everybody is aware of this. Of course the license permits it being done, but not everything that is permitted needs to be done, or at least that it is done might be communicated more prominently. To be clear I have not personal problem with any of this, this is only something that crossed my mind on ocassion and also just now, and to explain what I meant.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastActivityDate="2013-07-04T19:51:45.210" CommentCount="18" />

Even if a question was not yet edited, in the sense of the text having been changed, its edit history can still contain interesting information but there is no link to it, for example it contains the information who reopened a question (if this happened).

Quite the opposite, some of the TCS folks felt that their community may be better served by having a separate, dedicated Q+A site separate from MathOverflow.

If you want to discuss cstheory you should post on its meta not in other places. Moreover, you are not an active user on either of these sites so I am not sure you are qualified to express opinion on the issue. It is better to leave these issues to people who are actively using these sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, remember that an SE site is not defined by its topic but by its target community. We have argued about this kind of issues several times with people who are not active participants (e.g. shouldn't we merge MSE and MO?) and I should say I really don't understand why these people who are not actively participating on these sites feel confident and knowledgeable enough to make such major suggestions. It is amazing that almost always these suggestions come from people who are not active on these sites which is kind of annoying, even more so when they know that they shouldn't (as you did).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, these said, as a user (not a moderator on cstheory) I think there is a considerable overlap between MO and cstheory, and many theoretical computer scientists definitely feel that they are also mathematicians. But many theoretical computer scientists also definitely feel that they are computer scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a considerable number of questions on cstheory that might not be very welcome on MO. Note that we interpret TCS in a broad sense:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra. Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally don't have a strong opinion either way right now, I haven't thought about cons and pros. I also don't know how cstheory community would feel about this. It might be the case that cstheory community would be fine with a merge, so far we haven't felt a need to discuss it and right now I don't see why we need to discuss it other than to make the world fit into someone's mental picture who is not an active user on either site. If a user who is actively using cstheory suggests it and explains why a merge with MO can be beneficial for the cstheory community then we can discuss its cons and pros (on cstheory).

In fact this &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/183109/the-association-bonus-should-not-enable-users-to-vote-on-every-site&quot;&gt;request exists on meta.SO&lt;/a&gt; presented by Mad Scientist about a month ago. It could also make sense that those that care about it, voice there opinion there too, or at least vote on it. (I did not yet myself, but I think it is as simple as just login in as on MO and then one can vote due to the association bonus, somewhat ironic, though not quite as the meta.SO is a special case for a site.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some other things I now think it is somewhat reasonable. I did not yet say anything on math.SE but created an account recently, the actual motivation was to test something as a low-rep user somewhere, but also I could imagine to say want to say something on a question after it was migrated there, and then it would feel odd if I could not comment there, so there is some sense to this association thing, too. (Sure I could get the points otherwise there too, but if I want to leave a comment &quot;now&quot; I would be not happy if I could not.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sock-puppet voting I see less of a problem. Since for somebody to get something out of having sock-puppets here to vote the need at least to be in some sense in touch with the subject of the site. And, for those it is and also was never a real issue to ask some questions also on MO that would get them two upvotes total and not too many downvotes. (This is according to old rep, the new one is rather harder regarding this, so it is not all bad the changes.) And then we had also some that had some &quot;colleague&quot; ask a question that they then answered, so I would say it was always easy enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I still agree that for voting in general it is a bit of a problem, as it likely will still give more votes to the soft-ish things that already get too many votes, IMO.

And, it might be that on MO this is in general less relevant, since it is not so common that there are very similar answers given to the same thing, however it can also happen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular in such situations there is an effect that not rarely one of the answers &quot;wins&quot; in the end and gets significantly more votes than equivalent ones (on the grounds that it is ahead early on, and then some seem to only upvote one/the first they see (often sorted by votes), answer giving some piece of information and the gap widens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I think in a scenario where one answers in parallel with somebody else about the same thing, then sees the other answer, and then upvotes it. Then by doing so one likely actually harms ones prospects of getting points out of ones own answer (and also the accept). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is I think the scenario they mainly had in mind. As said on MO this is not so frequent but I think on other sites it happens all the time. (And such situations can cause friction; math.SE seems to have had various problems arising from such things.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And depending on how this badge is implemented precisely; if it is exactly as written, that is the number of answers one upvotes counts (and there is no exception for CW) then anybody being in some of big-lists could trivially get it just voting around there a lot.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that one can also get the badge in an &quot;absurd&quot; way is true for many and specifically for thos badges based on participation/volume.

Other entities, in whose hands this decision was, where a) the moderatots b) the system (by which I mean auto-CWing one edits or number of answers). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this was not at all only theoretical. There were cases of questions that were made CW by moderators &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the explicitly expressed wish of the author (to be clear I fully support these decisions). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For b) this also happened, at least upon edits (I think for the answer threshold it was mostly done before manually), mostly by accident, in an irreversible ways. (This persists but now can be reversed, which one also can see as improvement, although to be fair one could keep this improvement and still go back to the old way regarding other aspects.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, depending on how you read the above you might think this is nit-picking, however, what this also shows is that in my opinion and this is the point I want to make here: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The decisions if a specific question is to be CW or not was all the time much more a &lt;em&gt;matter of following guidelines&lt;/em&gt; [edit: replaced a word] regarding the type of questions that should be CW than an actual decision of the author. Some authors that knew about the guidelines merely did it right away. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, regarding the &quot;nothing to fear.&quot; Well, I am not so easy to scare, at least not by questions on MO, so no we have nothing to fear. But then since also the comparison to other sites is made where this might be an issue but here on MO it is not. I really recommend the blog-post I link below. The type of problems (if one sees them as problems, as some though not all do) on other sites described there are &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; analogous to what we have on MO, too. (As a general aside, while I agree MO is in some ways special, I think we should also avoid to overdo pointing this out, because then in various ways it seems to me the problems &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in fact quite similar, and the situations are not that different.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, for the specific qustions mentioned as example. It is even not so clear in my opinion that this must be CW for intrinsic reasons, and a slight modification (sharpening/improving the questions slightly) could make it in my opinion easily a non-CW question. (Again, I refer to the blog-post.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This example to me seems precisely like one where CW is &quot;abused&quot; (this is not directed against the author, it is a common use here after all). My reading of CW-ing here is, [added: this is as indicated by the 'my reading' my personal interpretation, and could be wrong, but there were examples where things like what I say below were made explicty by an author or by others in discussion] that the author was well aware there could be opposition to such a question (whether this is good or not is not the question), and it has three votes to close at the time of writing, yet via entering the CW grey-area thought to avoid some of it, and sufficiently much of it that the question &quot;survives.&quot; This is precisely how CW should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be used (that it was done a lot in the past does no change this).          &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Added: since apparently there is a considerable interest in my arguments (with 5 upvotes on the comment demanding them while half-way they are in comments already) here is one reason why I prefer the new systme over the old one and also the proposed one (somewhat redundant with comments): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A main point why I prefer the new system is that it should minimize certain small debates in comments that I do not find very productive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question of whether a question is CW or not is ultimately pretty much to the irrelevant end, in my opinion. In particular, this is not a very urgent matter. I agree some questions rather should be CW, but if they are not for a while early on it also does not change much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, for some reason some people seem to have relatively strong feelings about this (to avoid confusion, I do not mean Todd Trimble). Also, some, and sometimes the same approach this CW matter in ways I find strange. Berating users where it is really reasonable they did not know about it, or even worse could not even make it CW by themselves, some even voting to close over such things, which is one of the more inapproriate reasons for a vote to close in my opinion. Leaving comments  like: &quot;this is a community wiki question, voting to close until it is so labeled&quot; (the until is an additional strange detail, but anyway).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, and this annoys me really a lot out of principle: &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; OP to make it CW and at the same time &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; the question in non-CW.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a mystery to me how one can justify to do this. It is particularly annoying (but some seem unaware of this aspect) since then even if OP reacts in a timely manner moderator intervention is needed as the answers stay nonCW and CW is mainly so that the answers are in CW so a quite absurd situation arises. But even if I would not know this I cannot understand how one can ask for it to be CW and not oneself set the accompanying example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in my opinion, each such event reflects negatively on the site. With the new system this is a lot more unlikely to happen in this form. This is an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason for it is  AFAIK  is to discourage the type of questions that got asked in CW. See this blog post &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/&quot;&gt;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were debates surrounding this, so it is somewhat unlikely this will be changed (in the sense that others raised the same point with similar arguments we might make).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To your specific suggestion, I would be &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; introducing a rep limit, since this will only create confusion. (More generally, I consider the current situation as better than before, but having a (significant) rep limit would be worse than both; I do not give the argument for this general point as it might take the debate off-track.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a minimal rep limit for CW on the old MO (I think 10; the reason for this were posts made &lt;em&gt;in error in CW&lt;/em&gt; by first time users). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Already this caused confusion, as I think many did not know this, and some complained at first time posters for not having made their post CW, which in addition to  it not being very reasonable in any case, in my opinion; always felt particularly odd if one knew that they &lt;em&gt;did not have the choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there was now a different rep-limit this situation would come back and much worse, as for first time users even not knowing this one detail at least most would think, okay this is a first time user they might not have known, with a different limit this would not be so clear.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I am against a (significant) rep limit for making a post in CW. (For current situation or old one I would not care so much, but non-minimal rep limit is worse than both as said.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-07-13T16:14:55.593" LastActivityDate="2013-07-13T16:14:55.593" CommentCount="18" />

And, second, to potentially discuss the implications of  and potential solutions for this. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be more specific what I am talking about, a main usecase:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a lower bound on the length of characters a comment needs to have, sometimes one might wish to post a shorter comment and then a way in which some proceed  is to add some MathJax code, like &lt;code&gt;${}{}{}{}{}$&lt;/code&gt; that after having been processed does not display anything (under normal circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also some related things like, displayed equations to have a paragraph in a comment and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the problem or the inconvenience?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that some (or at least I) also view the site on devices where MathJax either does not process properly at all or very slowly. Then, this 'invisible'  formatting code is visible, and distracting, and it is not only distracting in the way some normally visible 'filler text' would be distracting, as for example it can happen that first it grays-out (slightly changing size) to then reappear as normal text. So that automatically attention gets focused on this 'movement' against the static background. Or, it simply contributes to slow down the site, impeding smooth scrolling and so on. Also, the paragraph in comments can 'suddenly' open-up while reading the comment when the MathJax is eventually processed. (Besides it being quite a bit too large for a paragraph, which can be inconvenient on devices with a small screen.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this was already misunderstood, let me stress that my problem is not with the fact that some post short comments. I do not mind this at all, and would not mind were there no character limits (actually I would strongly prefer it as then the issue discussed here would dissapear).  I only mind that this is done using MathJax. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I can see why &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; it is actually convenient to have such tricks available, but it is also my impression that it is frequently used just so, since people know how to do it, so they do it (some likely unaware of negative side effects), and I assumed that at least for some in some cases it would not make much difference to reply, say, 'Yes, this is possible.' instead of 'Yes. [plus some 'invisible' filler]' &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it is my hope that some might take the above mentioned problems into account when deciding whether to use such tricks or not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, possibly, somebody could make a good suggestion for other ways to achive the same without the negative sideaspects. Indeed, there appear to be also ways to do 'invisible' things differently, there are invisible characters that can be 'written' in various ways; personally, I do not yet know how to do this (there is various talk about this on meta.SO but I did not get it to work, which might be my ingnorance or that these workarounds meanwhile have been blocked) see &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/44011/zero-width-non-joiner-allows-unclickable-titles/&quot;&gt;Zero-width non-joiner allows unclickable titles&lt;/a&gt; for example.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-07-14T13:19:52.037" LastActivityDate="2013-07-19T12:33:57.617" Title="On using MathJax to create 'white space'" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;mathjax&gt;&lt;etiquette&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="24" FavoriteCount="1" />

My aim was to interpolate somewhat beteween the two points of view given in the two answers, yet giving somewhat more weight to the one that had more support. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The intent was also to stress more what can be asked or done than what cannot, not only but also as it should be rather on the 'what can is ask' page than on the 'don't ask' one. Not sure how well I suceeded though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I welcome feedback of all kind. Both regarding content, form, and details like the language (the goal is this will make it into the official documentation in one form or another so thus seems relevant). In particular, for the latter feel free to edit directly. (Also, for the former if you find it more convenient, but perhaps please leave a comment what you changed, so that it is a bit clearer than just from the revision history who thinks what).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To ask questions related to a (well-known) open problem, that is a problem of which you know that  it (yet not its solution)  is known at least to the experts in the relevant field, can be welcome. However, there are some things to consider, which are mainly consequence of general principles making a good question or a good problem a good fit for this site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you know that something is a (well-known) open problem, please, indicate this clearly in the question itself and provide some information or pointers to information on the context and status of the problem. In addition, please, use the open-problem tag (in addition to mathematical tags to indicate the subject). Otherwise, the unfortunate situation can arise that the only reply you get is something along the lines: 'This is a well-known open problem, see the following references.' This could be a valuable answer for you, had you not known it already, but since you know it already, it is likely not what you hoped for. Conversely, it can be frustrating for the person answering to spend time to provide you with information of which it then turns out you had already. Thus, please provide context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site is a question and answer site. Thus, the typical question should be of a form where you consider it as &lt;em&gt;reasonably likely&lt;/em&gt; that it is &lt;em&gt;answerable by somebody&lt;/em&gt; (at the time the question is asked). Therefore, this site is typically not a good fit for asking for solutions of a problem open since some time and known to most people most likely to answer it. Thus, if you know an open problem you consider as particularly interesting and you feel it is not sufficiently present in the literature or on the internet you might consider to contribute it on a site that collects open problems in mathematics such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openproblemgarden.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Problem Garden&lt;/a&gt; instead of asking it here. Or, you ask a &lt;em&gt;related question that seems more answerable&lt;/em&gt;, such as a question on the current progress towards the problem, a question on  known results in special cases, etc. (of course, always assuming that this information is both of interest to you and not readily accessible elsewhere; following the two general principles that you should try to ask only questions whose potential answers are of actual interest and value to you, and that you should try to look-up other sources of information before asking a question here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A situation where you come across a problem that you, and possibly some colleagues around you, cannot answer but of which it is not known to you that it is also known to many others already is &lt;em&gt;not what is meant by open problem&lt;/em&gt; here. A question on it is typically very welcome, provided it is presented in context and it is within the scope of the site (research-level mathematics) from a general point of you. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added:&lt;/strong&gt; the intent is to replace this text: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What about open problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;MathOverflow is not the right place to ask open problems. You should post questions you're actually seriously thinking about. If you're thinking about a well-known open problem, provide some background and ask about something specific related to the problem, like &quot;Such and such is a well-known open problem. So-and-so proposed this and that approach in the 80s. Does anybody know if this aspect of their proposal can be made to work under these circumstances?&quot; If you want to contribute to (or view) a list of open problems, visit the Open Problem Garden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If it turns out that a problem is equivalent to a known open problem, then the [open-problem] tag is added, and the question is converted to community wiki. After that, the question essentially becomes, &quot;What is known about this problem? What are some possible ways to approach this problem? What are some ways that people have tried to attack it before, and with what results?&quot; That way, the MO thread for the problem becomes a repository of resources related to the problem. Perhaps the answers could be organized by approach, with an outline of the basic approach, followed by a horizontal rule and a summary of what is promising about the approach and why it doesn't give a complete solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To join the discussion about how MathOverflow should deal with open problems, go to this meta.MO thread. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what the faqs said all the time (or at least since a very long time), and what also now is &lt;em&gt;a part of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/help/on-topic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, this text is not a &lt;em&gt;my  opinion&lt;/em&gt; on how open problems should be handled but by contrast &lt;em&gt;my attempt to write down&lt;/em&gt; how they are/will handled in accordance with the opinions expressed in other answers as well as in continuity with existing practise (as I see it), and also removing mention of procedures related to open problems until now mentioned in the faqs that did IIRC hardly ever happen like this in the recent and not so recent past (for example, I recall numerous questions where it turned out this is a well known open problem, but never was there any CW-ing or any attempt of creating anything like a resource). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-07-20T21:16:04.230" LastActivityDate="2013-07-20T21:16:04.230" CommentCount="10" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-07-20T21:16:04.230" />

And, I agree the phrase form the documentation encouraging posting question and answers should likely be modified for MO. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related to the example you give (added to clarify, I mean the abstract one not your specific case I did not look into this in detail as this is a general request for discussion) there is a point in general SE documentation, which was not explicity in MO documentation I think but implictly understood to apply (interpreted properly): Avoid overt self-promotion. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/help/behavior&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/help/behavior&lt;/a&gt; for details. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus also under SE &quot;rules&quot; your specific example might be excluded. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, I can imagine situations where it is still reasonable to ask a question where one knows an answer. In particular, if there are (or at least one suspects) multiple different answers possible. An example could be a list-type question where I would consider it as perfectly alright for OP of question to also contribute their own answer(s). (One might do so also in the question, but it can be clearer to maintain a clear distinction between question and answers.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, if somebody where, say, interested in diffeent ways of proving the same result (while knowing one or some), to hava quetion 'In which ways can one prove this' and also answer 'This is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; way.' would seem fine to me, as for most relevant matters it would be the same as 'Q: this is a way to prove this are there others?' no answer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the example that is mentioned in the blog-post was such that &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; answers than the one by asker where still possible (and it was sort of likely this was so).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mainly, I would see an issue with question-answer packages of one person that are more or less finalized from the start on, without much reasonable possibility or even interest from OP of having others' contributions in addition. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To avoid confusion: Of course the situation for learning the answer &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; having asked the question is completely different and here one certainly &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; provide the answer, or make clear in another way that one no longer has a need for an answer (say via flagging for closure) but the former seem preferable.

Dorais said he would not like to mention another site there as this is not the place, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; (if I understood him correctly) the ask page would be a good place, so what we are talking about now. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make more precise what the suggestion is in OP as I understand it: Presently we have (on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/ask&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/ask&lt;/a&gt; the site for asking a new question) a box: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How to Ask&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is your question about research level mathematics?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We prefer questions that can be answered, not just discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Provide details. Share your research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If your question is about this website, ask it on meta instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;visit the help center »&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;asking help »&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where there are links (I did not reproduce) to the help center, to how to ask, and to meta. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, if this is possible, I would find it a very good idea to add a sentence on and link to math.SE in this box. (Possibly not exactly the one suggested but something along these lines, for example, since some seem to be worried to tell people to ask on math.SE we could provide it more as information.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say like adding (but this is rough just to get the idea across): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is your question about research level mathematics?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If not, note that questions about mathematics at any level are welcome at math.SE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I do not know is if this is technically possible (in an easy way). Since again this box seems to be fixed in form the only thing being specific to MO being the &quot;research level mathematics&quot;, which is the &quot;on-topic&quot; of MO (and also appears elsewhere on the site). [This perhaps also in part addresses a concern raised by Todd Trimble, as there it can more or less only say the &quot;on-topic&quot; so if we do not intend to change this it must be &quot;research level mathematics&quot;; what the &quot;on-topic&quot; means &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; is to be defined in the help-center, where there is ample space.]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as a reply to Steven Landsburg: I can understand why somebody would not want to individually suggest a question to be asked elsewhere (but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what this question is about), yet collectively and abstractly &quot;we&quot; suggested and suggest &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt; other sites (in the official documentation). Thus, the question is not whether we do this at all but if we should do it at this precise place in addition (to other places where &lt;em&gt;we do so already&lt;/em&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastActivityDate="2013-07-22T11:16:05.277" CommentCount="11" />

However, my attempt was thwarted by the system's insistence that I need five total score (i.e. total upvotes minus downvotes) in the tag 'dg-algebras' to suggest the synonym, and I do not have it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that a lot of, if not most, synonyms are needed in fairly small tags where &lt;em&gt;very few&lt;/em&gt; people actually have any votes (e.g. 'dg-algebras'). So the five score limit for suggesting synonyms appears rather counter-productive, especially since most people who do have the required score are unlikely to be working on suggesting synonyms at least for now. Moreover, only users with more than 2500 reputation can suggest vote for synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I have a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary question 1:&lt;/strong&gt; How much, and what kind of discussion is required before creating a tag synonym?

I am personally not convinced at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedural question:&lt;/strong&gt; Should I instead always make a request at meta.mathoverflow (for example, in the thread &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.mathoverflow.net/questions/194/help-improve-tagging&quot;&gt;Help improve tagging!&lt;/a&gt;) when I want to add a synonym like the above? This procedure would appear to forego some (most?) possible benefits of allowing users to suggest synonyms. On the other hand, it would impose a minimum level of discussion before creating a tag synonym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main question (or feature request):&lt;/strong&gt; Can we simply remove the requirement of a total score of 5 in the tag for suggesting synonyms? Should we? We could &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; even keep that requirement (as it is now) for users to &lt;em&gt;vote&lt;/em&gt; on the suggested synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Some relevant meta.stackoverflow threads&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is the most immediately relevant meta.stackoverflow thread,&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/161971/remove-tag-score-requirement-for-suggesting-synonyms&quot;&gt;Remove tag score requirement for suggesting synonyms&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a similar request to the one I am making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, here is a thread describing some of the relevant inadequacies of the tag synonym system: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/175790/remove-the-tag-synonym-suggestions-entirely&quot;&gt;Remove the tag synonym suggestions entirely&lt;/a&gt;.

Questions for which you simply do not know the answer are not the issue, as those are the norm on MathOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, a question which simply states a famous open problem will often not be well received.

Nevertheless, when asking about an open problem, you should mention that it is known to be unsolved.

This principle also applies to questions about open problems. For example, the community will usually welcome inquiries on partial progress, results in special cases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if my question turns out to be a well-known open problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask a question which is widely known to be unsolved, someone will typically point that out and provide references to the relevant literature.

Where can I find a complete account of how they work?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, it appears that writing @FullUserName in a comment will lead to a comment notification alerting that user to the comment. Is it necessary to use the full user name? For example, if someone write @Joel in a thread in which I have already commented, will I be notified? Must I use the @ sign at all? (I find the @ sign to be an unnatural and disruptive element in the comments and would like to omit it whenever possible.) I guess we needn't use @ when making a comment on the person's own answer or question. Is the person asking the question automatically notified of comments on an answer to that question? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I noticed when writing a comment that if I start writing with, say, @Noah (I hope he won't mind if I use his username as a hypothetical example), then a little hovering overtext window displays a fuller username completion, e.g. NoahSynder (even though the actual user name of the user had a space: Noah Synder, so I find this window to be odd), but this window disappears when I put a comma, as in &quot;@Noah, now I begin my comment&quot;, but also it becomes bold when I follow the completion, as in &quot;@NoahSynder &quot;, but the window disappears when the comma immediately follows the name, as in &quot;@NoahSynder, &quot;. What is the significance of these various fonts and missing spaces and disappearing windows?

The system tries to match what follows immeadiately after the @ until the first space (and one final punctuation is ignored) to a username &lt;em&gt;with space  removed&lt;/em&gt;. Part of the username also works. So &lt;code&gt;@Joel&lt;/code&gt; is fine (except perhaps if there should be many Joels in the conversation) &lt;code&gt;@Joel David Hamkins&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;is the same&lt;/em&gt; as the system only looks until the first space (and ignores one interpunctuation-mark) thus &lt;code&gt;@Joel,&lt;/code&gt; also works, but &lt;code&gt;@Joel...&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@JoelDavidHamkins&lt;/code&gt; is what would be thecomplete version and what gets suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the window it is as you say it gives suggestions, you can type only part and select with 'tab' key to complete, if you select it becomes bold, exact match also makes bold as it is sort of autoselected. But you can also compltely ignore it. Just what is typed in the end is relevant, it is only an input-help (also see at the end).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That there is a fontchange is relevant as if there are still more than one match then there is more then one window and you can use 'tab' repeatedly to select one of them (the one selected is bold). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you continue it dissapears as there is no more match &lt;code&gt;@Joel,&lt;/code&gt; does not match part of your username but works as the interpunctuation is ignored, &lt;code&gt;@Joel&lt;/code&gt; (with space) there is also no more window as you are ouside the scope of the @ after a space and so there is no reason to suggest anything anymore, but with &lt;code&gt;@JoelD&lt;/code&gt; the window would still be there. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that some people can sometimes be notified that do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get suggested, namely users that edited the post and &lt;em&gt;moderators&lt;/em&gt; that closed a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additional remark: in principle, the @ is crucial but as it always was the case a comment on a post notifies owner of a post. So here you do not need it. And also if there is a unique user that could be notified, say I had commented on you question and you replied in a comment with no others present, then I also get automatically notified even if you do not use an @ (whether you use my displayname or not). In such a situation it can happen that a staring @name is autodelete upon submission of the comment. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second additional remark: no comments on answer do not automatically notify OP of question, you cannot even notify them via comments on the answer (except of course if they also commented there).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps a bit, though I fear my reply is not very structured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9072" LastEditorUserId="9072" LastEditDate="2013-07-25T02:16:18.210" LastActivityDate="2013-07-25T02:16:18.210" CommentCount="5" />

By contrast the name of this site simply &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; MathOverflow. (Look at the site there it says Mathematics in large letters here it says mathoverlow in the logo and MathOverflow in the title of the page, and everywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While adding another (virtual) server to stackexchange.com is essentially free, registering a domain name has an &lt;em&gt;actual cost&lt;/em&gt; (time and money) attached to it.&#xA;So, it would seem to me there has to be an actual benefit, not just 'for fun'. Do some people type the URL as mathsoverflow in error? (If this is frequent one might consider the idea, but only then.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also other issues, like, it might (but I do not know) be worse for search engines; why just mathsoverflow maybe for American-German relations do matheoverflow (the serious point here being if one starts having various domain names than it is not clear where to stop); one might in the end also get more vulnerable to 'scraper-attacks' and related things.    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;http://mathoverflow.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; leading nowhere, it seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.stackexchange.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://stackoverflow.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; is also a dead end. It is thus not clear to me why this should be any different for MO. Do (m)any of the sites that have their own URL also have one under SE.com, if not why should MO have one? And, even if others did, one might be against this for MO. The reason being that it is better to keep more indpedent identity.

Dorais recently said so himself, is that first it is not very visible and second if this is not only for internal book-keeping but also for showing to somebody possibly external to MO than meta is perhaps not the best place to direct them (with all its debates and so on). The advantage is it essentiall maintains itself. (This goes both for old and new meta.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On main.&lt;/strong&gt; This was tried once or twice, there is however some opposition against this as it is somehow off-topic and with the new meta, most arguments (tex, less discursive,...) in favor of having it on main over meta seem obsolete.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the blog attached to the site.&lt;/strong&gt; MO could have a blog hosted by SE (like some sites have) and there this could be &quot;reported&quot; possibly also other things. This might be an alright option if someone or a couple of people volunteer to do this. (As far as I understand, essentially everybody can get writing rights, but one does not have them automatically.) It might not be very visible though, and the format is a bit limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt; If none of the above, then likely one will need a dedicated site for it, since to host it just one some page might seem a bit confusing. Since MathOverflow exists as an entity it might be reasonable (even independent of this) that it has its own webpage; of course the main (only?) activity of MO &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a webpage, still there might be some things to present or to say, which do not fit completely on mathoverflow.net (how is mO organized, its history, its successes and everything else that comes to mind).

The main ones should be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the edit the question seems to deserve a downvote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person casting the vote just does not revisit the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the former seems justified and also for the second while not optimal I feel that it is reasonable that it happens. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the classification of downvotes, except for the second one (but erros happen), I can see good reasons for each of the remaining three. In some sense, while commenting on downvotes can be good practice there are also situations where it feels better just to downvote as the discussion caused by a comment might be still worse for OP. (To be clear, personally, this is more a wisdom in hindsight, in the sense that in retrospect I feel there were some situations were it had been better had I just voted and not commented in addition, which I did).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the ratio: one can certainly discuss it. The consensus view seems to be that upvotes should be a lot more frequent than downvotes. This is what essentially all (in fact, I am not aware of any exception) longtime users that vote frequently do. For your numbers: you can check this for each user. When you do so for high-rep users you will see that the &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; of the ratios you mention, a ratio of 1/10, is already relatively &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; relative to what many longterm users do. A ratio as high as 1/4 the second value you suggest seems about the highest one can find (among highrep-suers that vote frequently) and this is quite rare. (It should also be noted that pure numbers do not necessarily tell the full story here, since it also could depend if people care to downvote content everybody considers bad, but most, often including me, just do not bother to even vote on it.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But also checking these numbers can be interesting and sometimes surprising. It is not at all true that those that might seem strict in what they say, always vote down a lot, or those that seem always friendly do not downvote much.

The familiar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each player strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can force a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. The main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the second author and C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is computably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. The proof proceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call the first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment) is an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. An alternative argument proceeds via Presburger arithmetic, which is capable of interpreting the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This was a collaboration truly born on MathOverflow, as some of the authors have never met in person...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1946" LastEditorUserId="2000" LastEditDate="2013-08-12T18:51:04.263" LastActivityDate="2013-08-12T18:51:04.263" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-08-12T17:37:20.760" />

For lower bounds, we present specific positions with transfinite game values of $\omega$, $\omega^2$, $\omega^2\cdot k$ and $\omega^3$. By embedding trees into chess, we show that there is a computable infinite chess position that is a win for white if the players are required to play according to a deterministic computable strategy, but which is a draw without that restriction. Finally, we prove that every countable ordinal arises as the game value of a position in infinite three-dimensional chess, and consequently the omega one of infinite three-dimensional chess is as large as it can be, namely, true $\omega_1$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article is 38 pages, with 18 figures detailing many interesting positions of infinite chess.

Both of them have algebra questions,&#xA;of the same level and type as yesterday.  Fortunately, your experience from yesterday&#xA;helps you handle these relatively quickly.  Unfortunately it is more time spent away from&#xA;your area of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It goes like this for a while.  Then one day a student comes in saying he has a spherical&#xA;trigonometry question.  Great! You use that in your work on a daily basis, and look&#xA;forward to an interesting discussion.  However, this student just wants to know if the&#xA;addition formula and periodicity properties for sine are the same, not how to use it&#xA;to parameterize surface areas or boundaries.  You check your reference text and also&#xA;show them where it is in Wikipedia.  At least it was a different kind of letdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of this, you get a call.  A person (call him an unfunded researcher) has some&#xA;thoughts on solar collectors and found your name through his research.  Excellent! you say, &#xA;and tell him to come to office hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He arrives, and you look forward to having a rewarding discussion.  It develops that he too&#xA;is designing a collector of a similar shape, and wants to determine theoretical performance &#xA;values of his design.  Unfortunately, he wants to build it out of inflexible panels (you are&#xA;working on a design using something like fabric with a small but nonzero stretch&#xA;coefficient) and so none of his ideas will help you in the least.  Further, he uses&#xA;different terminology and seems not to acknowledge some of the discrepancies between&#xA;what he is saying and the science in the literature you have studied.  Not only is this&#xA;unlikely to further your work, it will take some time for you to help him on matters that&#xA;could be explained by a patient undergraduate student, since his main concern is calculating&#xA;the angles between different faces in his design.  Not a happy day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MathOverflow is not a generalized helpdesk with a focus on mathematics.  It is a forum&#xA;supported by a community with very specific goals, and with a realm of service that&#xA;is difficult to define.  Through trial and careful moderation, as well as eternally vigilant&#xA;filtering of content, a community of highly professional expertise has formed to handle&#xA;questions suited to them.  Your question is not a bad one, nor is it unsuitable for&#xA;discussion in some forum.  This forum is not good for it because the theory behind it&#xA;is not found in most graduate schools in mathematics.  Indeed, a computer science or computer&#xA;aided drafting forum might be more fit for it.  Also, much of the theory involved is&#xA;primarily analytic geometry, a subject often taught in high school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This community will not change itself to fit your needs. While it may eventually&#xA;formally define what questions it will handle, right now it is still determining that&#xA;realm.  I highly recommend a different forum.  If you were to persist, you might get&#xA;your question included, but then the community might disband before answering it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish you luck in your research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="35626" LastActivityDate="2013-08-23T00:29:25.847" CommentCount="3" />

If a discussion is getting ugly enough that you want it off the record, you should flag a moderator as soon as possible.

Instead, they are branching discussions with moving hotspots. What you need to host such a project is a platform like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discourse.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vanillaforums.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vanilla&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason why these posts appear here is because of MO's main asset &amp;mdash; a large community of highly knowledgeable mathematicians. It turns out you can have that if you're creative enough to take advantage of MO's main weakness &amp;mdash; an insatiable appetite for fresh mathematical questions. For example, when an interesting problem pops up in your project, post it on MO with a link to the project and reel in the goodness. It doesn't matter whether you catch users or answers, it's a win for your project and a win for MO!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a technical note, I would recommend creating a special tag to use on questions associated with the project. This way, you can have your own &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/my-event&quot;&gt;custom MO page&lt;/a&gt; that to facilitate back &amp;amp; forth flow. If this catches on, we should request an event tag mechanism so that these special tags don't pollute the tag ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In another note, there is a position available at MathOverflow for creating manageable side projects and other features for MO's public relations side.

For example, it can be a summary of information provided in comments, or somebody has a half-way answer and hopes somebody can finish it, provide missing details, improve it in other ways and so on. On MO it is not used much in this form, but on other sites one can find answers to which numerous users contributed (a bit like our big-lists but that they do the list in one or a few posts). This is also documented by the fact that for CW-posts the point-threshold allowing others to edit is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; lower (100 vs 2k). And, thus, the OP also does not gain any points from such an answer, since it is (to be assumed/likely) that not all the credit for the post should go to them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the same reason it makes sense to have this approach for the tag-badges, too. One could however envision that for badges this is different, since other score-based answer badges (nice, good, great answer and some others) are still given for CW answers.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Personally, I do not have any particular opinion what would be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, the behavior seems by design, it is documented in the following semi-official meta.SO post (part of the FAQ on badges) &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/68395/228113&quot;&gt;http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/68395/228113&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What counts is the score of non-CW answers (that are still present, i.e., not deleted).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding Question 2: I think the hover-text does not really describe the actual situation, and I cannot see any good reason for it. Either it should be precise (as suggested in OP) or it should be simple/over-simplified and not mention CW at all.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To mention CW but in an incorrect way seems like an oversight.

  <row Id="743" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="742" CreationDate="2013-08-30T11:15:36.113" Score="9" Body="&lt;p&gt;In my experience, MO mainly satisfies the following need that conferences used (for me) to fill: After thinking about a question for a long time, usually something technical that is holding you up, you have the opportunity to directly ask an expert. At the conference you'd think really carefully about what you say and brace yourself for the answer, hold your breath, and then ask. You'd have to be very careful when you ask, because the expert might have a Fields medal or be a rising superstar...they were, after all, invited to speak at a conference. So you only have one shot to get a good answer and the question should be formulated very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community is now the expert, but the idea is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second fortunate function of MO is the presence of the CW option. We can ask experts about their ideas that might direct or affect our, and the community's, approach to mathematics in general...as well as glean ideas that don't appear in papers. The answers to these are like the things speakers will mention in a talk that are complementary to, or that motivate, their results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second feature has developed despite the intention of the site playing the first role. I think this is mainly because a few high-profile members (like Bill Thurston) have opened the door to broader questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strongest criticism by colleagues of MO is that it might discourage young mathematicians (graduate students, for example) from thinking hard enough about their problems before looking for help with them. This is a valid criticism, if you believe in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0691029318&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the mathematical process as put forward by Hadamard/Poincaré&lt;/a&gt; for example. Briefly put: long periods of being stuck after working hard with no progress at all are often critical to kick the subconscious into high gear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Colleagues have also advised me to refrain from asking questions too frequently (understandably, if you regard MO community as a fields medalist...for example). They have advised that it looks more appropriate to &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; questions more often, since it doesn't appear that I'm trying to take an undue amount of attention from the community on the front page. This was good advice for me, since I'm rather excited about MO, don't have graduate students, and have a lot of questions that I'll probably never get around to working on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6269" LastEditorUserId="6269" LastEditDate="2013-08-30T15:03:35.397" LastActivityDate="2013-08-30T15:03:35.397" CommentCount="10" />

About the latter syntax, I'm surprised that it has ever worked (in LaTeX, not html!), but if it did, it's probably worth searching for it. As for the former one, I would suspect it was used often enough. I'm not sure if backslash-squarebracket actually is a meaningful command in LaTeX for generating square brackets, but people have definitely used it (maybe to get past markup?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2530" LastActivityDate="2013-09-02T17:32:44.347" CommentCount="1" />

I meant a posting with a hyperlink to the file. I can arrange to post the file on my website at my institution, and then put a link on MO, but my website may not be permanent, or I may move, and then the link would come up dry.
